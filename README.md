# Violin bow - simulation

Simple simulation how violin bow makes string vibrate at one frequency.

Simulation consists of weight on spring (horizontal). On the weiht is aplied force from bow, which is moving in horizontal direction on the top of the weight. Vibration is caused by static and dinamic friction between bow and weight (harmonic oscilator). Movement is fixed in horizontal direction.
